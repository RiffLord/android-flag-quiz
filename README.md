# Flag Quiz
This is a modification of the Flag Quiz from <i>Android for Programmers: An App-Driven Approach</i> by Deitel, Deitel, Deitel & Morgano.
The application uses the original assets provided and implements the quiz as in the book. User authentication has been implemented with
Firebase's e-mail & password verification and scores are saved in Firebase Firestore which is used to provide personal scoreboards and
global high scores. The user interface has also been modified with Material Design components replacing the original UI elements and a 
different colour scheme.
